## direct_solver.c

Solve the system directly. (LU Factorization)

## iterative_solver.c

Solve the system iteratively.

## MPI_direct_solver.c / MPI_iterative_solver.c

Using MPI to accelerate the process.


## Remark

The actual and detailed process is defined in the file `mysolver.h`. So you should finish that.
